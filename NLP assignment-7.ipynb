    "BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a deep learning model developed by Google that is used for natural language processing (NLP) tasks such as language understanding. The architecture of BERT is based on a transformer-based model, which is a type of neural network that uses attention mechanisms to process input data more efficiently than other approaches. The core component of BERT is its bidirectional encoder, which is a multi-layer transformer network that encodes text in both directions – forward and backward. BERT also uses a number of different techniques to improve its performance, including masking some of the words in the input text, training on large corpora of text, and using a special type of “pre-training” that allows the model to learn general language patterns. Finally, BERT can be fine-tuned to specific tasks by adding additional layers on top of the pre-trained model."

This allows the model to better understand the context of words and phrases, as well as their relationships with each other, so it can better predict the right word or phrase in the right context. MLM can be used for a variety of tasks, such as machine translation, question answering, text classification, and many more."

This means that the fine-tuning process can be much faster because the model has already been trained on a large dataset, so it can quickly learn the task-specific parameters. Additionally, the parameters from the BERT model can be reused during fine-tuning, so there is less time spent on training and more time spent on optimizing the task-specific parameters."

After the attention layer, several layers of Transformer blocks are used to further process the input sequence. These Transformer blocks, which are composed of multi-head attention and feed-forward layers, allow the model to learn relationships between the words and how they interact with each other.
